These files provide:
1. **.gitignore**: Proper exclusion of development artifacts, sensitive files, and OS-specific files
2. **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation covering:
   - Project overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Running the application
   - API documentation
   - Environment configuration
   - Testing
   - Contribution guidelines

You might want to customize:
- The specific features list
- Database instructions based on your actual DB choice
- API documentation path if using different tools
- License type if not MIT
- Any additional sections specific to your project

Would you like me to modify any part of these files or add additional sections?
